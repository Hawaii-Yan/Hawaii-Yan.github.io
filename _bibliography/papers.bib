  title={The Grassroots Spread of anti-epidemic slogans and the Exception State Fugue (Bachelor's Thesis)},
  author={Xiaokai Yan},
  abstract={The article, based on an interdisciplinary perspective, examines the field of anti-epidemic slogans through a triple fugue structure of media, rhetoric, and ethics. It explores the connections and tensions between this field and the theory of the state of exception proposed by the philosopher Agamben. The article discovers potential transformations in the state of exception in the post-pandemic era and critically analyzes and deconstructs the "Gordian knot" encountered by anti-epidemic slogans in grassroots communication and risk communication practices within this context. It seeks to capture experiential insights and provide corresponding recommendations.},

Simultaneously, there are specific discourse strategy differences between central and local mainstream media.},
